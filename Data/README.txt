Metabolomic datasets are provided for the gastric cancer and breast cancer examples.

- Gastric cancer

  - Healthy vs. Benign
    - Metabolomics_Healthy_Benign_ST001047.csv: Metabolomic data consists consists of
      - One row for each individual
      - Metabolite columns (named "M1", "M2",...) and a column named "class" with information about the class of each individuals (0: Healthy, 1: Benign).
    - Healthy_Benign_ST001047_pvSize_nr_5000_fmin_0.1_fmax_0.7_Df_0.05_TT_.csv: Results from the subsampling t-test method with alpha = 0.05, fmin = 0.1, fmax = 0.7, Df = 0.05, Rsubsamples = 5000 and th_beta = 0.5
